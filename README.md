# Loan-Risk-Analysis-and-Facial-ID-Recognition-using-ML-CNN-
Supervised Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Network model to classify whether loanees should be allowed to be given loan using dynamic background check and facial id recognition.

Models used includes Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DeepFace.

This project is created in collaboration with the following:
Ronaldo Syahputra, Titian F. Prasasti, Daniel Satria, Prabaningrum H.B.
